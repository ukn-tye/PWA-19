# PWA-19
This is my module 19 assignment and in this challenge I was tasked with making the backend of a text editor work. I was in charge of using ``idb`` and tools like ``express`` while working on this assignment. This was a very usefull and helpful challenge and might very well be one of my favorites. It was a little hard for me to finish and understand this topic earlier on but I was finally able to grasp the use of the tools and deploy a working repo.
